,,NewStar Financial,,,,,,Lender,,Boston,MA,,2004,,,,,"NewStar Financial was formed in June 2004 by a group of senior banking executives to capitalize on the opportunity to provide sophisticated financing alternatives to mid-sized companies and investors in the middle market. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, the company funds its lending activities with a combination of equity capital, credit facilities from large banks, and term debt securitizations. NewStar's direct lending activities are focused exclusively on providing sophisticated financing options to mid-sized companies through three national lending groups, leveraged finance, business credit and equipment finance. Through its asset management platforms, NewStar also offers a range of investment products employing credit-oriented strategies focused on both middle market loans and liquid, tradeable credit. In November 2014, NewStar formed a strategic relationship with Blackstone's GSO Capital that included a long-term investment in the company from funds managed by GSO to support the company's strategy to accelerate growth in its direct lending and asset management activities. In addition to the investment, the scope of the relationship included an arrangement for co-lending in certain types of transactions and investing in the company's middle market credit funds","Business Services Companies
